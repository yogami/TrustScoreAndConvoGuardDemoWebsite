**Prompt for Gamma:**

Create a sleek, modern, and high-contrast pitch deck for a B2B HealthTech product called "Compliance Stack Berlin". The aesthetic should be "Berlin Techno" meets "Medical Trust" (Dark mode, neon blue/green accents, serious font).

**Slide Outline:**

1.  **Title Slide**: Compliance Stack Berlin. "TrustScore + ConvoGuard AI". Subtitle: The Complete Audit Trail for EU AI Act/DiGA Compliance.
2.  **The Problem**: "The EU AI Act is coming in 2026." "Health Apps face €50k+ fines and DiGA delisting." "Compliance is currently slow, manual, and expensive."
3.  **The Solution**: The Unified Compliance Stack.
4.  **Product 1: TrustScore**: "Public Reputation Infrastructure." "Verified Badge for your website." "Real-time audit status (e.g., Ada Health 95/100)."
5.  **Product 2: ConvoGuard AI**: "Real-time Safety Layer." "Blocks risks instantly (Suicide, PII, Bad Advice)." "Generates BfArM-ready CSV Audit Logs."
6.  **How It Works**: Simple Integration. "1. Install SDK." "2. Get Badge." "3. Sleep Safe."
7.  **Pricing**: "Simple Startup Pricing."
    *   TrustScore: €79/mo
    *   ConvoGuard: €49/mo
    *   **The Bundle: €129/mo**
8.  **Call to Action**: "Start your pilot today." "Book a 30min onboarding." (Include placeholder for QR code).

**Visual Style:**
*   Use screenshots of terminal windows and code snippets for technical credibility.
*   Use "Shield" and "Lock" iconography.
*   Keep text minimal and punchy.
