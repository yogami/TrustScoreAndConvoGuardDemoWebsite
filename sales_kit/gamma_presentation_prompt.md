**Prompt for Gamma:**

Create a sleek, modern, and professional pitch deck for a B2B HealthTech tool called "Compliance Stack Berlin". The aesthetic should be "Berlin Techno" meets "Medical Trust".

**Slide Outline:**

1.  **Title Slide**: Compliance Stack Berlin. "TrustScore + ConvoGuard AI". Subtitle: Automated Audit Trails for Health AI.
2.  **The Challenge**: "The EU AI Act is approaching." "Health Apps face complex documentation requirements." "Compliance today is often manual and slow."
3.  **The Solution**: A Unified Compliance Toolkit.
4.  **Product 1: TrustScore**: "Reputation Infrastructure." "Display your audit readiness publicly." "Example: 95/100 Readiness Score."
5.  **Product 2: ConvoGuard AI**: "Real-time Safety Layer." "Helps prevent high-risk responses." "Logs interactions for your audit reviews."
6.  **How It Works**: "1. Integrate SDK." "2. Monitor Safety." "3. Export Logs."
7.  **Pricing (Pilot)**:
    *   TrustScore: €79/mo
    *   ConvoGuard: €49/mo
    *   **Bundle: €129/mo**
8.  **Call to Action**: "Start your pilot." "Book a 30min demo."

**Visual Style:**
*   Use abstract tech visualizations (shields, nodes).
*   Avoid claiming specific government certifications.
*   Focus on "Tools for Compliance" rather than "Guaranteed Compliance."
