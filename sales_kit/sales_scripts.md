**Subject:** Compliance Stack for your Health AI (TrustScore + ConvoGuard Live)

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I built Berlin's first Health AI compliance stack to handle the upcoming EU AI Act requirements:

*   **TRUSTSCORE:** Public reputation scores (See Ada Health: 95/100 verified)
*   **CONVOGUARD:** Real-time conversation validation (suicide -> BLOCK, audit-ready CSV)

Both are live on Railway right now.

Can I show you a 30min demo?

## 🗣️ 90-Second Pitch (For Video & Demo Table)

**(Hook)**
"Health AI is exploding, but the EU AI Act 2026 is coming. Right now, no complete compliance stack exists for startups."

**(The Solution - Show TrustScore)**
"This is TRUSTSCORE. [Show iPad/Screen]. It gives your AI a public verified badge. See here? Ada Health is at 95/100. It checks for GDPR and MDR compliance instantly."

**(The Protection - Show ConvoGuard)**
"And this is CONVOGUARD. [Show Terminal]. Watch this. If a user says 'I want to kill myself' -> BAM. Blocked instantly. Plus, it generates a BfArM-ready CSV export for your audits."

**(The Ask)**
"You can get the whole stack for €129/mo. I'm onboarding pilots today. Want to book a 30min demo to see if it fits your stack?"
